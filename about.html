    <p>
      I am a Polish full-stack developer working with React and Rails. Besides
      backend and frontend, I am interested in DevOps and machine learning.

      It is essential for me to stay up to date with the newest IT trends, that
      is why I decided to start a blog. The next reason is that I enjoy helping
      others so if you have a problem with the technologies I mentioned leave a
      message and we will try to solve it together.

      Privately, I like to read books (e.g. Lovecraft's, Glukhovsky's) and
      lately, I grew obsessed with eating healthy and staying fit.

      P.S. I am not that handsome. It is just a wig. :)
